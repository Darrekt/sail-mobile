# Sail

An app that makes being apart a little less painful for couples separated by distance.

## Design

This app uses [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) for state management.

### Running tests

Before you run tests, you need to autogenerate all the mock classes by running

```dart
dart run build_runner build
```

After which, you should be able to run `flutter test`.
