# Sail

An app that makes being apart a little less painful for couples separated by distance.

## Design

This app uses [Bloc](https://bloclibrary.dev/#/) for state management. Read up on basic concepts and see the design document below for details on how we separated the concerns of all the different blocs to handle our business logic.
